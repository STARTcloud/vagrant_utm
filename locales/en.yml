      download_confirmation: |-
        IMPORTANT: Due to limited UTM API support, this plugin does not know when the download is finished.
        1. Headover to UTM and confirm to download UTM file.
        2. Make sure the file is loaded and exists as last VM in UTM list (UI).
        3. If the downloaded VM name is same as existing VM, UTM will throw pop-up and 
        you need to change the name of existing VM and retry `vagrant up`.

        started: |-
          The VM is started. To stop this VM, you can run `vagrant halt` to
          shut it down forcefully, or you can run `vagrant suspend` to simply
          suspend the virtual machine. In either case, to restart it again,
          simply run `vagrant up`.

        not_created: |-
          The environment has not yet been created. Run `vagrant up` to
          create the environment. If a machine is not created, only the
          default provider will be shown. So if a provider is not listed,
          then the machine is not created for that environment.
